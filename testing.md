# Testing

It's very important that your code is tested: you want to be sure that your code does what you think it does. Use a framework that you're comfortable with, and test as much of the code as is sensible.

Use tools to help with other types of testing:

* [PageSpeed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) to generate a checklist of things to improve;
* [WebPageTest](http://www.webpagetest.org/) to generate stats and measure performance;
* [pa11y](http://pa11y.org/) to check accessibility.

# Technology and tools

## Frameworks

Frameworks can be useful, but be wary of using them by default. Think carefully about the problem you're solving by using a particular framework, and about the cost of using it to you, your team, and your users.

Frameworks have some Pros. They:

* can make complex things simpler;
* are often well maintained and well tested.

Frameworks also have some Cons. They:

* add a dependency to your project;
* can be overkill for the problem you are trying to solve;
* can be painful to upgrade;
* can have a steep learning curve;
* are solving someone else's problem, not yours.

Roll your own framework, but borrow from the best. Look at [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/), and other frameworks for ideas.

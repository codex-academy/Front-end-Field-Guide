# Technology and tools

## HTML

### HTML5

### Accessiblity

### Metadata

### Images

### Templating

## CSS

We keep all our CSS in a few, minified, external CSS files. We don't use inline style blocks or write inline CSS.

We write our CSS like [SMACSS](http://www.smacss.com/). CSS is organised into: Base; Layout; (lots of) Modules; States. We keep nesting shallow, and never use IDs for styling.

We make sites Responsive by default as a Future Friendly measure.

We prefer to move into HTML, CSS, and JS sooner rather than later and build [Front-end Style Guides](http://styleguides.io/) (something like [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io/)) that evolve into pages and templates.

### Naming conventions

### Frameworks

### Preprocessors

## JavaScript

We write unobtrusive, js-hinted, JS. We keep all our JS in a few, minified, external JS files. We donâ€™t use inline script blocks or write inline JS. We only include [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) when really necessary, preferring vanilla JavaScript code and [micro-frameworks](http://microjs.com/).

We [Cut the Mustard](http://responsivenews.co.uk/post/18948466399/cutting-the-mustard) to serve less capable browsers just the core, lighter and faster, experience, rather than send them lots of code they will struggle to run.

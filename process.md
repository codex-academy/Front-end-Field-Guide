## Front-end Style Guides

We shouldn't be designing websites as pages anymore: we should be designing systems of components. A popular way to think about this is to use Brad Frost's [Atomic Design](http://patternlab.io/about.html). A site is divided into tiny pieces that are combined into components, then those components are combined into bigger components. A useful way to look at the system is: Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, Ecosystems. Anna Debenham has an excellent set of [Style Guide-related resources](http://styleguides.io/).

Starting from this point, and using [Style Guide Driven Development](http://blog.bitovi.com/style-guide-driven-development/) can be very powerful, and help everyone on the team have their head in the right space for designing and developing for the multi-device world.

Ideally, a Style Guide should be part of your application. The folks at Lonely Planet have done this with [Rizzo](http://rizzo.lonelyplanet.com/). If you can't do this for your application, the next best thing is for the Style Guide and application to use the same CSS and JS files.

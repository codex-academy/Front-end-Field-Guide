## One Web

## Progressive Enhancement

Websites should be built so that people can access them quickly and easily, regardless of the device they're using, the type of connection they are on, or any disabilities they have. That means building things with **Progressive Enhancement**.

A basic, functional, experience is delivered to everyone; JavaScript is not required for any key functionality. Feature tests in JavaScript are used to load in additional CSS and JS enhancements that the browser can handle. Different browsers will be served different experience; they will be consistent and may be quite similar, but will not be identical.

Front-end performance and accessibility are important, so running regular performance and accessibility audits is recommended.

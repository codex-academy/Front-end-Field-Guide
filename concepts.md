# Concepts

## One Web

Websites should be built so that people can access them quickly and easily, regardless of the device they're using, the type of connection they are on, or any disabilities they have. That means building things with **Progressive Enhancement**.

## Progressive Enhancement

A basic, functional, experience is delivered to everyone; JavaScript is not required for any key functionality. Feature tests in JavaScript are used to load in additional CSS and JS enhancements that the browser can handle. Different browsers will be served different experience; they will be consistent and may be quite similar, but will not be identical.

Front-end performance and accessibility are important, so running regular performance and accessibility audits is recommended.

### Cutting the Mustard

Levels of optimisation.
Support everything, optimise for your audience.

## Responsive Web Design

Don't use device-specific breakpoints. Let your content decide your breakpoints.

Build squishy things.

## Mobile First

Content first, navigation second.

## Future Friendly

* Acknowledge and embrace unpredictability.
* Think and behave in a [future-friendly](https://www.futurefriendly.co.za/) way.
* Help others do the same.

## Performance

* Prefer fewer, larger HTTP requests to many, smaller, ones.

### Inline, Internal, and External (CSS and JS)

### Caching

### Concatenation, Minification, Gzip
